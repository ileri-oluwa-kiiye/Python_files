This text file is to summarise what I have learnt so far in this python journey:

With the 'Python_Crash_Course' notebook, 
I learned about strings and variables firstly.
A variable could contain a string and all of that. I'm very not good at summarizing actually.
a string is usually in the form: 'This is Ileri'
Yes, it is usually bounded by 'Single' or "double" quotation marks.
There are floats, decimals, integers also.

I learnt about lists, booleans, tuples, dictionaries too.
I should actually go through them tomorrow and finish typing this text file.
